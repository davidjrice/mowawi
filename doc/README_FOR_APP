A user decides to add a "node".
A node is a restaurant, a cinema, library, house, building, junction - it's a single point on a map.
A user adds the name of this node, address, phone number, photo, details, etc, and lat/long.
A user is told of other nodes in the immediate area, and on the "path" -this helps check the address details.
A path is a street, river, path, lane, - it's a linear linking of nodes, it has a beginning and an end but is not a single point on a map.
User confirms node addition.
